# Abstract

One-shot voice conversion (VC) with only a single target-speaker speech for reference has become a new research direction. Existing works generally disentangle timbre, while information about pitch, rhythm and content is still mixed together. To perform one-shot VC effectively with further disentangling these speech components, we employ random resample resampling for pitch and content encoder and use adversarial mutual information learning to ensure the different parts of the latent space contain only the desired disentanglement during training. Experiments on the VCTK dataset show the model is a state-of-the-art one-shot VC framework in terms of the naturalness and similarity of converted speech. In addition, we can transfer style of one-shot VC on timbre, pitch and rhythm separately by speech representation disentanglement.

### There's a horizontal rule below this.

### Here is an unordered list:

*   Item foo
*   Item bar
*   Item baz
*   Item zip

### And an ordered list:

1.  Item one
1.  Item two
1.  Item three
1.  Item four

### And a nested list:

- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
    - level 3 item
    - level 3 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
- level 1 item

Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
